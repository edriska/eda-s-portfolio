In that business case; the challenge was handling a dataset comprised entirely of free text, I employed an Azure AI solution, specifically the Azure Cognitive Sentiment Analysis feature. This tool allowed me to determine sentiment scores, distinguishing between positive and negative comments.

To delve deeper into customer feedback on hotels, I focused on discerning impressions related to food and cleaning. I curated a keyword list and systematically applied it to the comments, counting the frequency of specific terms. I then crafted a DAX query to quantify these keyword mentions.

Subsequently, I organized the insights into two distinct calculated tablesâ€”one for food-related comments and another for cleaning. This facilitated a detailed analysis of sentiment trends across different years. The dataset was sourced from booking.com, accessed through Azure Blob.

This approach not only streamlined the handling of unstructured data but also provided valuable insights into customer sentiments. Combining sentiment analysis with keyword frequency assessments enabled the creation of meaningful tables, offering a comprehensive exploration of customer complaints related to food and cleaning over various years. Utilizing Azure AI tools enhanced the efficiency of the analysis, making it a robust and insightful process.

The second business case is about a sailing race in that challenge I should create a dashboard and show each boat current location and show the boats current location and rank by the boat challenge was made a lambda architecture, used the Event hub, and streamed the analysis to the Power Bi dashboard and it should be figured out what should I do batch processing part I used in that part SQL database and make my analysis in there wrote a SQL codes in the Event hub calculated the distance and ranked the boats by distance also I want to rank by speeds and want to see rank differences between them. In that business case, you can see how did write SQL code and make a pipeline from scratch using Azure Stream Analytics Job.
